# Blog Post for User-Centered Programming Interface Seminar

This is a repository for submitting the final blog post for the UCPI seminar.

## What is a blog post?
The final blog post should give any computer science student, even if they've never heard of the topic, a quick and clear understanding of what it’s all about. It should highlight the latest research in the area and include some interesting thoughts and perspectives from you, the author, to keep things engaging.

The blog post is different from writing a summary of a research paper, or writing a literature review. You should write it in accessible and conversational tone to make technical content understandable and engaging for a broad audience. You can find examples here at Blog@CACM: https://cacm.acm.org/section/blogcacm/.

## Is there a template or structure?
There is no template or structure. Length-wise, please keep your blog post around 800~1200 words. However, we do ask you to provide your name, and a short bio to be included on the final course website.

In general we are hoping to see the following perspectives being covered by your blog:

- Motivating the research topic: Is the topic well-motivated? Is the relevance of the topic clearly explained?

- Depth of the content: Does the blog post provide valuable insights for experts? Does it demonstrate the author's deep understanding of the topic?

- Engagement and clarity: Does the blog post explain ideas in a way that general audiences can understand? Is the content engaging?

- Writing: Is the blog post well-written? Does the author cite and integrate quality sources?

- Bonus point -- Forward-thinking: Does the blog post offer new insights or creative perspectives on the topic? We encourage you to think wild about the future of programming interfaces on your chosen topic.

## Should I find additional papers on the topic?
Yes, we expect you to find additional papers on the topic -- you might have already done a good job finding them for your presentation! If you mention an idea from a paper, or an article, please cite them properly using the APA style.

But keep in mind this is not a literature review so we are not chasing for numbers. It' about providing a targeted review and discussion on a topic. On the reading list, you already have 2-3 readings on this topic, and in the end, we are looking for >=5 sources.
